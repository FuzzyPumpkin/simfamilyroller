#Sims4FamilyRoller
a randomizing program for household creation in The Sims 4

This app was built in React and saves expansion/game/stuff pack settings to local storage so that users can filter the results they get by their available options in-game. It also includes options for controlling family size and fund upper and lower limits. While there are many roller programs out there for individual sims, I had not found one that would do an entire household in one go. 

Sims4FamilyRoller was created using functional components only and one reusable hook I've traded between projects. It utilizes several dictionary files for options like traits and careers. Text in the program is conditional based on the sex of the sim rolled.

This app was created to fill a personal need as well as a request by a couple of social groups I am in and has an established audience actively using it and contributing suggestions.
